# 🏨 Hotel Booking Analytics  

This project analyzes hotel booking data using **MySQL**, **Python**, **Excel**, and **Power BI** to uncover key business insights for the hospitality domain.  

---

## 🌟 Key Features  
- Analyze **total revenue** and **average ADR** by hotel and room type  
- Track **booking and cancellation trends**  
- Compare **guest satisfaction** across different hotels  
- Build an **interactive dashboard** to visualize business performance

## ⚙️ How It Works  

### 1️⃣ SQL — Data Extraction and Cleaning  
Data was stored in **MySQL**, where SQL queries were used to clean, transform, and prepare the dataset for analysis.  

### 2️⃣ Python — Data Analysis  
Python scripts (`hotel_analysis.py`, `hotel_analysis_final.py`) connect to MySQL, load the dataset using **Pandas**, and perform data analysis and visualization with **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.  

### 3️⃣ Excel — Data Review  
The cleaned dataset was exported as **`hotel_bookings_.xlsx`** for review, validation, and Power BI import.  

### 4️⃣ Power BI — Dashboard Creation  
An interactive **Power BI dashboard** visualizes insights like revenue, satisfaction score, ADR, and cancellation trends.  
The final dashboard was exported as **`Hotel_Booking_Analysis.pbix.pdf`**.
