##  How It Works  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ SQL ‚Äî Data Extraction and Cleaning  
Data was stored in **MySQL**, where SQL queries were used to clean, transform, and prepare the dataset for analysis.  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Python ‚Äî Data Analysis  
Python scripts (`hotel_analysis.py`, `hotel_analysis_final.py`) connect to MySQL, load the dataset using **Pandas**, and perform data analysis and visualization with **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Excel ‚Äî Data Review  
The cleaned dataset was exported as **`hotel_bookings_.xlsx`** for review, validation, and Power BI import.  

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Power BI ‚Äî Dashboard Creation  
An interactive **Power BI dashboard** visualizes insights like revenue, satisfaction score, ADR, and cancellation trends.  
The final dashboard was exported as **`Hotel_Booking_Analysis.pbix.pdf`**.
